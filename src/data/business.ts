export const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much does a concrete driveway cost in The Colony, TX?",
    answer: "Concrete driveway costs in The Colony typically range from $8-$18 per square foot, depending on size, thickness, and finish. A standard 400 sq ft driveway costs $3,200-$7,200. Stamped or decorative concrete costs more. Call (469) 972-8639 for a free estimate."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does concrete take to cure?",
    answer: "Concrete reaches about 70% strength in 7 days and full strength in 28 days. You can typically walk on new concrete after 24-48 hours, but should wait 7 days before driving on a new driveway."
  },
  {
    question: "What areas do you serve near The Colony?",
    answer: "We serve The Colony and the entire DFW metroplex including Frisco, Plano, Lewisville, Little Elm, Carrollton, Flower Mound, McKinney, Allen, Prosper, and surrounding areas."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer free estimates?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer free, no-obligation estimates for all concrete projects. Call (469) 972-8639 or fill out our online form to schedule your free consultation."
  },
  {
    question: "How thick should a concrete driveway be?",
    answer: "A residential concrete driveway should be 4 inches thick for regular vehicles. For heavier vehicles like RVs or trucks, we recommend 5-6 inches. Commercial driveways typically require 6-8 inches. All our driveways use 4,000 PSI concrete for maximum durability."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you use rebar in concrete driveways?",
    answer: "Yes, we use #4 rebar or wire mesh reinforcement in all driveways for optimal strength and crack prevention. Rebar is placed on chairs 2 inches from the bottom. This extends driveway lifespan by 30-40% compared to unreinforced concrete."
  },
  {
    question: "What PSI concrete do you use for driveways?",
    answer: "We use 4,000 PSI concrete for all driveways, which exceeds the 3,500 PSI minimum for residential use. Higher PSI means greater compressive strength, better durability, and improved resistance to heavy vehicles and weather."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remove and replace an old concrete driveway?",
    answer: "Yes, we provide complete driveway demolition and replacement services. Old concrete removal costs $2-$4 per square foot depending on thickness and accessibility. We haul away debris, prepare the base, and pour new concrete. Most replacement projects take 3-5 days total."
